## **📝 Description**
![](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRYSRYuCQgVOstpubsE4sy7oJJDxCaLizGOSg&s)

This project focuses on classifying handwritten digits from the [MNIST dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer/data). It explores and compares the performance of various machine learning algorithms, including Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), to determine the most effective method for recognizing digits in images. 

📥 Download the checkpoint for each model from this [Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xBeDRDks7EBTjflbYL7hXEvMZdwMm_io/view?usp=sharing) and place it in the project folder.

## **✨ Features**
* 🔄 **Data Preprocessing**: Normalize image data to ensure compatibility with machine learning algorithms.

* 🤖 **Model Training and Evaluation**: Train and evaluate various models, including Neural Networks, SVM, and KNN, for handwritten digit recognition.

* 🖥️ **User Interface**: Integrate a user-friendly interface for easy interaction and testing.
