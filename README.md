This project focuses on classifying handwritten digits from the [MNIST dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer/data). It explores and compares the performance of various machine learning algorithms, including Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), to determine the most effective method for recognizing digits in images. 

Download the checkpoint for each model from this [Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xBeDRDks7EBTjflbYL7hXEvMZdwMm_io/view?usp=sharing) and place it in the project folder.
## **Features**
* Data Preprocessing: Normalize image data to ensure compatibility with machine learning algorithms.

* Model Training and Evaluation: Train and evaluate various models, including Neural Networks, SVM, and KNN, for handwritten digit recognition.

* User Interface: Integrate a user-friendly interface for easy interaction and testing.

## **Installation**
Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fisherman611/handwritten-digits-recognition.git
   ```
(Optional) Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Navigate to the project directory:
